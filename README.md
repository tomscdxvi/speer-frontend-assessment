Speer Technologies Front End Assessment

This is my Speer Frontend Assessment Documentation...

Code is a little messy due to time restrictions.

Things I couldn't do on time
  1. Incorporating Images to Red, Yellow and Blue sections.
  2. Mouse Hover Animation over Red section.
  3. Not responsive (This is a website and isn't meant for mobile use for now).
  4. Hero section wallpaper buttons do not work.

Features 
  1. Hero section wallpapers fully change every 10 seconds.
  2. Buttons all have animations.
  3. Hamburger Menu with fixed Menu.
  4. Try It Now redirects user to Pricing page.
  5. Pricing page select buttons redirect user to Payment page.
  6. Payment page textfields all have colour change when focused and the colour is removed upon unfocusing.
